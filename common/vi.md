# Not familiar with vi ?
If you are not familiar with vi this is a very short intro

vi is a modal editor, there are two modes, navigating around (done using the cursor keys on your keyboard) and editing

To edit navigate to the place you want to change using the keyboard arrows,

**x** key on the keyboard will delete the character under the cursor

**i** key will switch to editing mode and start to insert in front of the cursor (you can use delete etc.)

To switch back to the navigation mode then press the **Escape** key on your keyboard.

When you have finished changing the file then press the **Escape** key on your keyboard then press **ZZ** (that's capital Z twice) to save the file and exit
